# UE-test-
# Unreal Engine 5 Development Tasks

## Objective

## Task/1: Procedurally Generated Terrain

### Description
Create a procedurally generated 10x10 terrain using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5. The terrain should feature:
1. Significant height variations, including large mountains.
2. Assigned materials for the terrain surface.
3. Optimization for mobile performance.

### Deliverables
1. Blueprints used for the terrain generation.
2. Screenshots or screen recordings demonstrating the generated terrain.
3. Performance metrics, including FPS and latency, showcasing the optimization process.

## Task/2: Save/Load Game System

### Description
Develop a save/load game system using C++. The system should:
1. Export user data outside of UE as a CSV or JSON file.
2. Include player data such as player transform, health, coins, stamina, and player ID.
3. Save and load game data, storing it in the CSV or JSON file.

### Deliverables
1. C++ code for the save/load game system.
2. A save game file exported outside of Unreal Engine as a CSV/JSON file.
3. Screenshots of the character Blueprints integrating the C++ code.
4. A screen recording of the save/load process, including the exported files at runtime.
