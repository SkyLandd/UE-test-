# Unreal Engine 5 Development Tasks

## Objective

## Task/1: Procedurally Generated Terrain

### Description
Create a procedurally generated 10x10 terrain using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5. The terrain should feature:
1. Significant height variations, including large mountains.
2. Assigned materials for the terrain surface.
3. Optimization for mobile performance.

### Deliverables

2. Screenshots or screen recordings demonstrating the generated terrain.
3. Performance metrics, including FPS and latency, showcasing the optimization process.

## Task/2: Save/Load Game System

### Description
Develop a save/load game system using C++. The system should:

2. Include player data such as player transform, health, coins, stamina, and player ID.
3. Save and load game data, storing it in the CSV or JSON file.

### Deliverables
1. C++ code for the save/load game system.
2. A save game file exported outside of Unreal Engine as a CSV/JSON file.
3. Screenshots of the character Blueprints integrating the C++ code.
4. A screen recording of the save/load process, including the exported files at runtime.

## Deadline
The entire task must be completed and submitted within 2 days from the start of the test.
